#Cache Disabler
A simple FireFox add-on which provides a button to completely disable (and re-enable) the cache with a single click.

This add-on is intended to make it easy to disable both the disk and in the in-memory caches, and to serve as an indicator of the cache state, so you can see at a glance whether the cache is on or off.

It is inspired by the "Cache Killer" extension available for Google Chrome. There is the "CacheToggle" add-on for FireFox which appears to address a similar need, but which doesn't work without the addon bar which was removed in FF 29.
